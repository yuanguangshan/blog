The Crossroads of Destiny

At crossroads of life, where choices intertwine,
A soul stands, burdened by fate's heavy hand,
In shadows cast by doubts, its heart does pine,
To chart a course, to heed life's grand demand.

Shall it follow the path of least resistance,
Where comfort lies, but dreams may fade away?
Or brave the unknown, embrace existence,
And chase the sun, where passion holds its sway?

Oh, fickle heart, what choice shall thee make now?
To settle for the mundane, a life mundane,
Or dare to dream, against destiny's brow,
And dance with stars, where wonders shall attain?

At crossroads of life, destiny awaits,
Choose wisely, for thy choice shall seal thy fate.
